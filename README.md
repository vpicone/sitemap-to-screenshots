Generate screenshots from your sitemap

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. place your `sitemap.xml` file in the root of the directory
2. default resolutions are `['360x640', '1366x768']` replace them in `gulpfiles.js` if desired. (More resolutions means longer run time.)
3. run `npx gulp` in the root directory
